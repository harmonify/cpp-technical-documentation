			<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
			</p>
			<p>C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>desktop applications,</li>
				<li>video games,</li>
				<li>servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and</li>
				<li>performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</li>
			</ul>

			<header>History</header>
			<p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++. The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.</p>
			<p>Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.</p>
			<p>In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.</p>
			<p>In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy (who had previously suggested Unix pipes).</p>
			<p>In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.</p>
			<p>In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.</p>
			<p>In 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in 2003.</p>
			<p>After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17. After becoming finalized in February 2020, a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020 and officially published on 15 December 2020.</p>
			<p>On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, "for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language".</p>
			<p>As of 2021 C++ ranked fourth on the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages, after C, Java, and Python.</p>

			<header>Compability With C</header>
			<p>C++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.</p>
			<p>Some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++. Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant).However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.</p>
			<p>To intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern "C" {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
			<header>Hello World</header>
			<p>The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"; and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages."</p>
			<p>C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{<p></li>
					<li><p class="indent-1">std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; endl;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
			<header>Declaring Variables</header>
			<p>In order to create a variable, we use a special kind of declaration statement called a definition</p>
			<p>Here’s an example of defining a variable named x:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>int x; //define a variable named x, of integer type</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>When the compiler sees this statement, it makes a note to itself that we are defining a variable, giving it the name x, and that it is of type int. From that point forward, whenever the compiler sees the identifier x, it will know that we’re referencing this variable.</p>
			<p>It is possible to define multiple variables of the same type in a single statement by separating the names with a comma. The following 2 snippets of code are effectively the same:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>int a;</p></li>
					<li><p>int b;</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>is the same as:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>int a, b;</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
			<header>Data Types</header>
			<p>C++ comes with built-in support for many different data types. These are called fundamental data types, but are often informally called basic types, primitive types, or built-in types.</p>
			<p>Here is a list of the fundamental data types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>int</li>
				<li>char, wchar_t, char8_t (C++20), char16_t (C++11), char32_t (C++11)</li>
				<li>float, double, long double</li>
				<li>string</li>
				<li>bool</li>
				<li>short, long, long long (C++11)</li>
				<li>std::nullptr_t (C++11)</li>
				<li>void</li>
			</ul>
			<p>C++ also supports a number of other more complex types, called <i>compound types</i>.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="iostream">
			<header>iostream</header>
			<p>The input/output library (io library) is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output. We’ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console. The io part of iostream stands for input/output.</p>
			<p>To use the functionality defined within the iostream library, we need to include the iostream header at the top of any code file that uses the content defined in iostream, like so:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
					<li>&nbsp;</li>
					<li>//rest of code that uses iostream functionality here</li>
				 </ol>
			</code>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="std::cout">
			<header>std::cout</header>
			<p>The iostream library contains a few predefined variables for us to use. One of the most useful is std::cout, which allows us to send data to the console to be printed as text. cout stands for “character output”.</p>
			<p>As a reminder, here’s our Hello world program:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "Hello world!"; // print Hello world! to console</li></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</li></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>In this program, we have included iostream so that we have access to std::cout. Inside our main function, we use std::cout, along with the insertion operator (<<), to send the text Hello world! to the console to be printed.</p>
			<p>std::cout can not only print text, it can also print numbers:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << 4; // print 4 to console</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>This produces the result:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>4</ol>
			</code>
			<p>It can also be used to print the value of variables:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include <iostream> // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>int x=5; // define integer variable x, initialized with value 5</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << x; // print value of x (5) to console</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>This produces the result:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>5</ol>
			</code>
			<p>To print more than one thing on the same line, the insertion operator (<<) can be used multiple times in a single statement to concatenate (link together) multiple pieces of output. For example:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>This program prints:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>Hello world!</ol>
			</code>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="std::endl">
			<header>std::endl</header>
			<p>What would you expect this program to print?</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "Hi";</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "My name is Alex.";</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			<p>You might be surprised at the result:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>Hi!My name is Alex.</ol>
			</code>
			<p>Separate output statements don’t result in separate lines of output on the console.</p>
			<p>If we want to print separate lines of output to the console, we need to tell the console when to move the cursor to the next line.</p>
			<p>One way to do that is to use std::endl. When output with std::cout, std::endl prints a newline character to the console (causing the cursor to go to the start of the next line). In this context, endl stands for “end line”.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li><p>#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for std::cout</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>int main()</p></li>
					<li><p>{</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "Hi"<< std::endl; // to move the cursor to the next line of the console;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;</p></li>
					<li><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li class="indent-1"><p>return 0;</p></li>
					<li><p>}</p></li>
				</ol>
			</code>	
			<p>This prints:</p>
			<code>
				<ol>Hi!<br>
				My name is Alex.</ol>
			</code>
